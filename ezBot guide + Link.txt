EZBOT FOR BOTTING ACCOUNTS on Patch 7.1
Frist, you will need ezbot and Elobuddy, you can download it from HERE https://github.com/fkingnoobgg/lolbot/releases/tag/1.0.1.7
+ Elobuddy.net
ezBot is not made by me it is made by Tryller and updated by Hesa and fkingnoobgg
After you downloaded it extract it to a folder (its ok on your desktop)
===Config Part===
Enter settings.ini in config folder, now frist change your lol path folder
[GENERAL]
LauncherPath=Y:\games\League Of Legends\    Set this to where your league of legends folder is (where you installed LoL)
MaxBots=2                                                                   You can change this but it depends on your computer
MaxLevel=31                                                               Set this to 31 so you can bot accounts even if they are lvl 30 cause you cant reach lvl 31 in this game
RandomSpell=false                                                    Set this to true IF you want the bot to take random spells each time (better set it to false so its more human-like, no one at lvl 30 will take cleanse and ghost)
Spell1=Ignite                                                                Set this to ignite/flash/heal or any spell that you want (THIS AND SPELL2 MUST NOT BE THE SAME)
Spell2=Heal                                                                  Set this to ignite/flash/heal or any spell that you want (THIS AND SPELL1 MUST NOT BE THE SAME)

[ACCOUNT]
MinDelay=1600   This is the delay between accounts, you can tweak a bit those numbers if you want but its not that important
MaxDelay=9485
BuyExpBoost=false This is if you want your account to buy xp boost (mostly you dont want it to spend your rp so you may want to set this to false)

SreenHeight=480    
SreenWidth=800
LOWPriority=true                      This will play even if your account has leave buster (better keep it true)
LOWGraphics=true                  This will set your lol graphics on low so your bots will have more FPS (better keep it true)

AfterXGames=0
AlsoCloseComputer=false
